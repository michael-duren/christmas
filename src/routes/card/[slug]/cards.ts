You are the most supportive mother out there, and have always tried to help me when things were difficult or I was at my lowest. 
So here's to celebrating christams with the best mother out there, and to many more years of christmas celebrations to come.
P.S.
I'm not sure what we're having for food today, but I'm sure it will be delicious, and Richie will have fun with the christmas tree.

Happy we've made it through another year, merry christmas.

  It'll be weird not having you here for the holidays, but I'll be traveling and see you soon.
So we'll have plenty of time to annoy each other this year, even if it's not from playing super smash bros.
I'm proud to have you as my brother, and happy that Sigrid is in your life, and becoming part of the family.
I'll have presents coming later to the both of you, once I'm a bit caught up financially.
Hope you guys have a fun, cozy christams, love you both.
